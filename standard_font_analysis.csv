that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation: it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty
and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave, my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there
snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and
in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe. Its productions and features may be without
example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes. What may
not be expected in a country of eternal light? Imay there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle
and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming
eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never
before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements, and
they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage
with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up
his native river. But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I
shall confer on all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to
reach which at present so many months are requisite: or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all
possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.
