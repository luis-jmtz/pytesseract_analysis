Understanding Curve Detection
A curve in this context refers to a noticeable change in direction 
along the contour of a character. A simple straight line will have a relatively 
constant angle between adjacent segments, whereas curves will cause the angle to vary 
more significantly.

Curve Detection:

Angle Difference: When the difference between the angles of two consecutive 
line segments exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 15 degrees), we consider this 
as an indicator of a curve. This threshold can be adjusted to be more sensitive or more lenient.
Why 15 degrees?: This is a reasonable heuristic to detect significant 
changes in direction. If the difference between the angles of two consecutive line 
segments is greater than this threshold, we classify it as a curve. A smaller threshold 
could result in detecting even subtle bends, while a larger threshold would ignore small 
variations in line direction.

Concepts:
Character Spacing / Kerning: This refers to the spacing between characters in a font. The default character spacing can be retrieved using font metrics, which are embedded in the .ttf file.


Advance Width: This is the width of a character, which includes both the character itself and the space to the right of it. The kerning value can affect how characters are spaced in combination with other characters, but we are looking for the "default" or average spacing between characters without any kerning.
