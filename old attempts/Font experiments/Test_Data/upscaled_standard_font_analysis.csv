of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost
and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is
Sor ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour. There—for with your leave,
my sister, I will put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea,
we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
globe. Its productions and features may be without example, as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in
those undiscovered solitudes. What may not be expected in a country of eternal light? I may there discover the wondrous
power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to
render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. I shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the
world never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man. These are my enticements,
and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with
the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native
river: But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on
all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present
so many months are requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at all possible, can only be effected
by an undertaking such as mine.

times new roman.png,"Tam already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play
upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze,
which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
