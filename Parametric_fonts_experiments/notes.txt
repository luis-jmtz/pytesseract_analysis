* Weight (wght): 100 - 1000
    Adjust the style from lighter to bolder in typographic color, by varying stroke weights, 
    spacing and kerning, and other aspects of the type. This typically changes overall width, 
    and so may be used in conjunction with Width and Grade axes.

* Grade (GRAD): -200 - 150
    Finesse the style from lighter to bolder in typographic color, without any changes overall
    width, line breaks or page layout. Negative grade makes the style lighter, while positive 
    grade makes it bolder. The units are the same as in the Weight axis.

Slant (slnt): -10 - 0
    Adjust the style from upright to slanted, also known to typographers as an 'oblique' 
    style. Rarely, slant can work in the other direction, called a 'backslanted' or 'reverse 
    oblique' style.

Width (wdth): 25 - 151
    Adjust the style from narrower to wider, by varying the proportions of counters, strokes,
    spacing and kerning, and other aspects of the type. This typically changes the 
    typographic color in a subtle way, and so may be used in conjunction with Weight and 
    Grade axes.
