of promise, my daydreams become more fervent and vivid. I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost
and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is
for ever visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour: There—for with your leave,
‘my sister, Iwill put some trust in preceding navigators—there snow and frost are banished; and, sailing over a calm sea,

the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his native
river: But supposing all these conjectures to be false, you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on
all mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries, to reach which at present

upon my cheeks, which braces my nerves and fills me with delight. Do you understand this feeling? This breeze,
which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
